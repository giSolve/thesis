    \begin{itemize}
        \item How realiable are theoretical results on t-SNE? Do the assumptions hold for real-world datasets? \pause
        \item Do parameters suggested in theoretical results lead to better performance in practice? \pause
        \item Which parameters are most important for obtaining good results? \pause
        \item How does initialization impact t-SNE results across different datasets? \pause
        \item How can we deal with large datasets? Does rescaled t-SNE work in practice?
