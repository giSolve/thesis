Now, we recall the original problem (\ref{eq:og-prob}).
We assume that the domain $D(\bs{y})$ is given as a random deformation of a reference Lipschitz domain $D_{\text{ref}}\subset \bR^3$ with piecewise smooth surface $S_{\text{ref}} \coloneq \partial D_{\text{ref}}$.
Further, we assume that this deformation can be encoded in a parameter $\bs{y} \in [-1,1]^{\bN}$ (cf. \cite{DOLZ2022114242}).
We will approximate the parameter space $[-1,1]^{\bN}$ by a finite dimensional space $[-1,1]^N$ where $N$ is large enough.
Our aim is to compute stochastic quantities of interest of the eigenpairs, namely their expectation.
As our parameter space is high dimensional, we want to use a quasi-Monte Carlo method, which is preferred to Monte Carlo due to the higher convergence rate.

When employing sampling-based numerical methods to calculate the expectation, such as quasi-Monte Carlo, the challenge of relating eigenvalues to each other across the samples arises.
Even if the trajectories of the eigenvalues are given by continuously differentiable paths, it is not evident how to track these over the discrete samples, especially when the random parameter is high dimensional, as crossings and bifurcations could occur.
We use an approach that exploits the more meaningful stochastic properties of the eigenspaces \cite{Doelz_Ebert_2024}.

Our goal is to compute the expectations of the eigenvalues that lie within a given contour $\Gamma \subset \bC$.
In order for the method to work, we require that the eigenvalues that lie inside of $\Gamma$ are separated by our contour over the entire parameter space from the rest of the eigenvalues (cf. \cite{kato_perturbation,grubivsic2023stochastic}).
