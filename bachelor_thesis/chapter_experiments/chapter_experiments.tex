\section{Datasets}
We use the following datasets for our experiments (as well as synthetic data). 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Iris dataset \cite{iris_dataset}
    \item MNIST \cite{mnist_dataset}
    \item EMNIST letters \cite{emnist_dataset}
    \item flow cytometry \cite{flow_dataset}
    \item Macasko mouse retina \cite{Macosko_dataset} 
\end{itemize}

\section{Dataset Cluster Assumptions}
Here we investigate if assumptions made for clustering results in \cite{LinStei22} hold in practice, by looking at the simple Iris dataset. 

\section{Initialization}
Here we reproduce results from \cite{kobak21} on synthetic data and show that t-SNE with PCA initialization can reconstruct geometric shapes up to some extent. 

We also investigate the effects of PCA initialization on real-world datasets.

\section{Effect of Varying Perplexity Values}
there were some figures here before I removed them. 

\section{Early Exaggeration}
what effect does it have?
