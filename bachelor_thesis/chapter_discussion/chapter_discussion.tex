\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chapter:conclusion}

As pointed out in \cite{kobak21}, \enquote{it remains challenging to measure how faithful a given embedding is}. It would have been interesting to look at other quality measures, for example rank based criteria \comment{cite rank paper here}. 


Mention the difficulty of interpreting t-SNE plots \cite{Wa16Distill}. 

Say that maybe t-SNE is not the best for outlier detection and better for finding clusters.
