    \textbf{Positive aspects}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Method that avoids matching problem completely
        \item Discretization that retains structure of the problem
        \item Contour integral method as powerful tool to compute eigenspaces
        \item Convergence rates of boundary element method and QMC
        \item Multilevel approach possible
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Further questions}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Expensive computations of single layer boundary integral operator approximation prevents us from computing better reference solutions
        \item Analysis of the approximation of eigenfunctions
    \end{itemize}
